This repository contains a tiny project showing how to create C++ bindings
using [nanobind](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind) and
[scikit-build-core](https://scikit-build-core.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). It
was derived from the corresponding _pybind11_ [example
project](https://github.com/pybind/scikit_build_example/) developed by
[@henryiii](https://github.com/henryiii).

Furthermore, the [bazel](https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind_example/tree/bazel) branch contains an example
on how to build nanobind bindings extensions with Bazel using the [nanobind-bazel](https://github.com/nicholasjng/nanobind-bazel/) project.

Installation
------------

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pip install ./nanobind_example`

Afterwards, you should be able to issue the following commands (shown in an
interactive Python session):

```pycon
>>> import nanobind_example
>>> nanobind_example.add(1, 2)
3
```

CI Examples
-----------

The `.github/workflows` directory contains two continuous integration workflows
for GitHub Actions. The first one (`pip`) runs automatically after each commit
and ensures that packages can be built successfully and that tests pass.

The `wheels` workflow uses
[cibuildwheel](https://cibuildwheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automatically
produce binary wheels for a large variety of platforms. If a `pypi_password`
token is provided using GitHub Action's _secrets_ feature, this workflow can
even automatically upload packages on PyPI.
